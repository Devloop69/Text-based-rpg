This project is a text-based RPG known as `Dragon's Cave`. I created it just for fun.
It has colors and has a decent sized map.
Has some items such as potions, power-ups, etc. and has a final boss.
If you have a Python debugger or console, you can run the .py file on it. If not, then you can use the executable.
Don't worry about `load.txt` file. It just saves your progress and your items.
This game is not a virus and if your encouter any problems while running it, you can bypass the windows firewall.(If you`re eager to play)
This game is a short journey, enjoy it.
